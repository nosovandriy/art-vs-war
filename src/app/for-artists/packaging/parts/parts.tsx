      <li className={style.list}>Cover the front of the painting with glassine paper.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Glassine is a smooth and glossy paper that&apos;s resistant to air, water, and grease, which
        will keep the front of your painting protected while it&apos;s being shipped. Lay the
        glassine paper over the surface of the painting. Wrap the paper around the edges of the
        painting and use painter&apos;s tape to secure the paper to the backside of the painting.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find glassine paper at craft supply stores, department stores, and online.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you&apos;re shipping a very small piece, you can trim the glassine paper with scissors
        and cover your painting with it.

        Tape 4 strips of painter&apos;s tape over the glass of framed paintings.
      </li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        If you&apos;re shipping a framed or mounted painting that has a glass covering, take 4
        strips of painter&apos;s tape and form 2 &apos;X&apos; shapes from the edge of the frame
        that overlap in the center to form a star pattern. Make sure the strips of tape are securely
        attached to the glass to prevent pieces from coming loose and damaging the painting if it
        breaks in transit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don&apos;t use scotch or duct tape or you&apos;ll leave behind a sticky residue on the
        glass.

        (Recommended) Put cardboard corner protectors on mounted or framed paintings.
      </li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        If you have a mounted or framed painting, slide cardboard corner protectors over each of the
        corners of the frame. Use strips of painter&apos;s tape to secure them to the frame so they
        don&apos;t fall off.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find cardboard corner protectors at shipping supply stores and online.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wrap the corners with loose pieces of cardboard if you don&apos;t have corner protectors.

      <li className={style.list}>
        Use packing tape to secure the foam boards around your painting.
      </li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Hold the foam boards in place with your hands and wrap strips of packing tape around the
        edges to sandwich the boards around your painting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don&apos;t tape them so tight that the tape creates impressions in the boards or the
        excessive pressure could damage the painting. Wiggle the boards with your hands to make sure
        they&apos;re secure.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find packing tape at shipping supply stores, department stores, and online.

      <p className={style.title}>Choosing the Right Container</p>
      <li className={style.list}>Measure the length, height, and width of the painting.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Use a ruler or tape measure to find the measurements of your painting. If the painting is
        mounted in a frame, be sure to measure the width of it so you can choose an appropriate box.
        Write down your measurements so you have them handy and can use them to choose the best
        container for your painting.
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>Add 15 cm (6 inches) to each measurement.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Calculate extra space for packaging and padding that you&apos;ll add to keep your painting
        from moving around. Add the extra length to all of the measurements that you took so your
        final calculation is accurate and consistent.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, if your painting had a length of 25 cm (10 inches), a height of 30 cm (12
        inches), and a width of 10 cm (4 inches), then adding the extra space for packaging and
        padding will give you a length of 40 cm (16 inches), a height of 45 cm (18 inches), and a
        width of 25 cm (10 inches).
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>
        Choose a corrugated picture box for framed or mounted paintings.
      </li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Go to a box supply store or look online and select a pre-measured mirror or picture box that
        matches the measurements of your painting, including the extra space for cushioning. Choose
        a new, double-walled corrugated box to minimize movement and reduce the risk of damage to
        your painting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Look online for a box supply store in your area for boxes with specific dimensions.
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>Select a shipping tube for unmounted, rolled-up paintings.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Unmounted artwork can be rolled up and placed in a shipping tube to be protected while
        they&apos;re being shipped. Measure the shortest side of the painting while it&apos;s flat
        and then add 10 cm (4 inches) to the measurement to allow for extra space for padding and
        choose a shipping tube that fits the measurement.
        <br />
        <br />
        For instance, if the shortest side of your unmounted painting measures 25 cm (10 inches),
        then choose a shipping tube that&apos;s at least 35 cm (14 inches) long.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find shipping tubes at box supply stores, office supply stores, and online. Your
        local post office may have some shipping tubes on hand, but they may not match your
        measurements.

      <p className={style.title}>Shipping the Painting</p>
      <li className={style.list}>Place a framed or mounted painting into the container.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        If you&apos;re shipping a framed or mounted painting, take the wrapped painting and slide it
        into the frame or mirror box. Insert it so that it&apos;s completely inside of the box.
        There will be a little bit of excess space around the painting inside of the box.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don&apos;t force the painting into the box or you could damage it.
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>Slide a rolled-up painting into the shipping tube.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        For rolled-up paintings, take the roll that&apos;s wrapped in a layer of bubble wrap and
        gently slide it into the shipping tube. Slide it all the way to the bottom of the tube,
        leaving a small amount of space at the top and around the painting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Do not place the end cap on the tube until you&apos;ve filled the extra space inside of it.
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>Use bubble wrap to fill voids in the shipping container.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Take strips of bubble wrap and slide them into the space around your painting to add
        additional cushioning. Make sure you add bubble wrap to the top and bottom areas and use any
        excess to fill the spaces between the painting and the packaging.
        <br />
        <br />
        Give the package a good shake to make sure the painting doesn&apos;t move around inside of
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Packing peanuts can settle and leave parts of the painting exposed to potential breakage.
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>Seal the container with in 5 cm (2 inches) packing tape.</li>
      <p className={style.description}>
        Use the packing tape to cover all of the seams on the top and bottom of the box or the end
        caps on the shipping tube. Apply vertical strips of the tape to the sealed flaps of boxes to
        provide extra strength and keep them from bending easily in transit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don&apos;t use duct tape or scotch tape, which may peel off during shipping.
      </p>
      <li className={style.list}>Bring the package to the shipping company to mail it.</li>
